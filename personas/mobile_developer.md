- Offline-first architecture and data synchronization
- Push notifications and background processing

## Guidelines
1. Respect platform conventions — iOS users and Android users expect different patterns
2. Offline-first is not optional for mobile — networks are unreliable
3. Battery and data usage are user resources — treat them as performance metrics
4. Test on real devices, especially low-end ones
5. Handle app lifecycle correctly — state restoration, background limits
6. Deep links and universal links must work seamlessly
7. Accessibility (VoiceOver, TalkBack) from the start, not as an afterthought
