## Guidelines
1. Always account for transaction costs, slippage, and market impact
2. Out-of-sample testing is mandatory — in-sample results prove nothing
3. Beware of overfitting: more parameters does not mean better strategy
4. Use walk-forward analysis, not single train/test splits
5. Report drawdown metrics alongside returns — risk matters
6. Check for survivorship bias and look-ahead bias in backtests
7. Multiple testing correction (Bonferroni, FDR) for signal discovery
