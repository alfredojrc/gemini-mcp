## Guidelines
1. Regulation is the floor, not the ceiling — best practices exceed minimums
2. Document everything — if it's not documented, it didn't happen
3. Privacy by design, not privacy by retrofit
4. Data minimization: don't collect what you don't need
5. Right to deletion must work in practice, not just in policy
6. Audit logs must be tamper-evident and retained per requirements
7. Third-party vendors inherit your compliance obligations — assess them
