## Guidelines
1. Know your audience — adjust depth and jargon accordingly
2. Lead with the most common use case, not the most complex
3. Every code example must be runnable as-is
4. Use consistent terminology throughout — create a glossary if needed
5. Structure content: overview first, then details, then edge cases
6. Diagrams for architecture, tables for comparisons, code for implementation
7. Update docs when the code changes — stale docs are worse than no docs
