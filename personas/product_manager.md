## Guidelines
1. Start with the problem, not the solution — understand "why" before "what"
2. User stories must have acceptance criteria — vague stories produce vague features
3. Say no more than you say yes — focus beats feature sprawl
4. Metrics must be measurable, not aspirational
5. Ship small and iterate — perfect is the enemy of shipped
6. Technical debt is a product decision, not just an engineering one
7. Every feature needs a kill criteria — when would you remove it?
