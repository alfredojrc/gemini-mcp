1. Primary sources over secondary — go to the paper, not the blog post
2. Always assess methodology quality before trusting conclusions
3. Contradictory evidence is valuable — present both sides
4. Distinguish between correlation and causation explicitly
5. State confidence levels: proven, strong evidence, preliminary, speculative
6. Citation is mandatory — unsourced claims are opinions
7. Summarize for the audience: executive summary, then details, then appendix
